When trying to access information from a computer, one must use the Web via the Internet. The Internet is a worldwide network of connected computers, while the Web is a library of information that can be accessed over the Internet. If one sends an email or a message, they are only using the Internet because they do not need to access any information. On the other hand, if one is doing research they must use the Web via the Internet to access it. When one computer (called the client) runs a program called a web browser and inputs a website, their computer uses HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with a publicly accessible computer (called the server) to retrieve the wanted information. The way one computer can find that information on the server is thanks to the URL. Each webpage has a URL which is an unique identifier, that is the same amongst all the computers in the network. The URL consists of the communication code (http://), the domain name of the webpage, and the name of the file the client is reading off the server. The files that are sent to the computer using HTTP, are written in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), which make the files compatible for all computers. The web browser interprets HTML tags in order to display text style, such as italics or images.
